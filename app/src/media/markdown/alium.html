<h3>Technical</h3>

  <p>
    We made a custom Wordpress theme build with <a href="https://www.upstatement.com/timber/">Timber</a> and <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/">ACF PRO</a>. For the e-commerce part, we used <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> and severals plugins for technical features.

    <ul>
      <li>Cache</li>
      <li>Paypal integration</li>
      <li>Language translation (polylang)</li>
      <li>Yoast SEO</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The most interisting page to do was the bike configurator. To achieve this, we had to rewrite the plugin <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-visual-products-configurator/9058551">Visual products configurator</a>.</p>
