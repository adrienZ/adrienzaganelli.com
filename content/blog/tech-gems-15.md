### PGLite is SQLite for PostgreSQL

<RichLink href="https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite" title="pglite on Github"></RichLink>

You can now work with Postgre databases without a server. With PGLite, your database can be in memory, in your filesystem or directly in [indexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). This is huge for testing as you run can this [locally](https://x.com/sitnikcode/status/1826646718777016772). It's also good to know that [Drizzle ORM already supports it](https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/latest-releases/drizzle-orm-v0306).
