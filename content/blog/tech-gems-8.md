### Train your local AI and build your UI with Ollama and Docker

" title="Inside Look: Exploring Ollama for On-Device AI
"></RichLink>


In this very detailed guide, we learn how to serve an AI model with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), pulling a model from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) and build your UI with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### The future of Javascript tooling is Rust

<RichLink href="https://thepassle.netlify.app/blog/rustify-your-js-tooling" title="Rustify your js tooling"></RichLink>

In this article, Pascal Schilp explains the next-gen tooling for the Javascript ecosystem will be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). He also describes the state of the art in this field by demoing 2 tools: [napi.rs](https://napi.rs/) and the [OXC project](https://oxc-project.github.io/).

### A community dedicated to technical documentation

<RichLink href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/" title="writethedocs.org"></RichLink>

Write the docs is a community around developer documentation, they have a [Slack](https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/). I learn about them in this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd8k4s7O3GM). You may want to look at [readme-checklist](https://github.com/ddbeck/readme-checklist) and [feedmereadmes](https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes) to write better readme.
