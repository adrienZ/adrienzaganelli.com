### Context

::video-loop{src="/videos/devialet-1.mp4" caption="Devialet PHANTOM PREMIER"}
::

For this project, [Devialet](https://www.devialet.com/) asked us to showcase his brand new speaker in an immersive experience. Indeed the e-commerce page wasn’t very appealing, so they made a marketing campaign, offline and online.

<iframe src="https://tinyurl.com/zag-embed" width="500" height="645" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>

In less than a month, we have experimented several technologies and ideas until the client give us his blessing. The delivery went fine and they were very happy about the website which ended on the homepage of Devialet’s website.

### Technical

- We used component to reuse text types, buttons, containers, titles… all of this powered by [Brindille](https://github.com/brindille/brindille)
- The apparition of elements on the scroll is handled by [anime.js](https://animejs.com/) timelines
- The HTML templating is made with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) for the CSS.

The client has chosen to keep simpler CSS effects on the 3 main words: Pure, Dense, Immersive…however, we had proposed a version with advanced WebGl effects, see for yourself:
