### Context

Project for a client who wanted to build his own bikes brand. We had to create it from scratch: website, social networks, seo, communication strategyâ€¦

### Conception

The specificity of his brand is the customization of their bikes through a configurator in the purchase funnel. The website tone had to be neutral to showcase the products

### Technical

We made a custom WordPress theme build with [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) and [ACF PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/). For the e-commerce part, we used [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) and several plugins for technical features.

- Cache
- Paypal integration
- Language translation (polylang)
- Yoast SEO

The most interisting page to do was the bike configurator. To achieve this, we had to rewrite the plugin [Visual products configurator](https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-visual-products-configurator/9058551).
