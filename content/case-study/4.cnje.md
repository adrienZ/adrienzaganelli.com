### Context

The french CNJE [(National confederation of Junior Entreprise)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_enterprise) updates its website every year, I had the chance to participate at the development of the 2018’s version.

During this project, I worked remotely from home while doing my internship at Sketchfab. The mission was to finish the website as soon as possible by resolving complex frond-end issues.

### Technical

This project was made with the wordpress theme [Rocket](https://github.com/TheoKleman/rocket). I spent most of my time building a filter system including search, category filter a and infinite scroll while doing some integration.
We had a very little time to resolve tickets from client’s feedsback and still manage to fix them all.
