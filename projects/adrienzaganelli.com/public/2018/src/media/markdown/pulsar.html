<h2>Pulsar One [Ã˜]</h2>

  <p>Pulsar one is a (french) text-based game where the story evolves depending on your choices. You are the chosen one who has to save the world.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

  <p>During my 2nd year of school, we had to make a game. Our team wanted to make a storybook, during a trimester we worked on it while having other classes. We ended it up by getting the best grade of our promotion.</p>

<h3>Conception</h3>

  <p>One of the hardest part of the project was to write a complete a non-linear story. Contrary to a linear story (begin, middle, end), the plot is connected between events, so the storyline is evolutive and adapt to the player's choices. You can also win rewards when doing certain actions.</p>
