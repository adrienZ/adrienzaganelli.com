<h2>Alium Bikes</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>

  <p>Project for a client who wanted to build his own bikes brand. We had to create it from scratch: website, social networks, seo, communication strategy...</p>

<h3>Conception</h3>

  <p>The specificity of his brand is the customization of their bikes through a configurator in the purchase funnel. The website tone had to be neutral to showcase the products</p>

<h3>Technical</h3>

  <p>
    We made a custom Wordpress theme build with <a href="https://www.upstatement.com/timber/">Timber</a> and <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/">ACF PRO</a>. For the e-commerce part, we used <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> and several plugins for technical features.

    <ul>
      <li>Cache</li>
      <li>Paypal integration</li>
      <li>Language translation (polylang)</li>
      <li>Yoast SEO</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The most interisting page to do was the bike configurator. To achieve this, we had to rewrite the plugin <a href="https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-visual-products-configurator/9058551">Visual products configurator</a>.</p>
